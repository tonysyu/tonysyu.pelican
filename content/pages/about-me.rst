About me
========


I'm a software developer at `Enthought, Inc.`_, but my background (B.S., M.S.,
Ph.D.) is in mechanical engineering. As a graduate student, I spent a lot of
time developing software in Python_ for data analysis, image processing,
numerical simulation, and visualization. Eventually, I decided that I didn't
like publishing, so I left the cocoon of academia and focused on what I liked
most: data analysis and visualization. I'm a core developer for scikits-image_,
the author of mpltools_, and a contributor to Matplotlib_.
