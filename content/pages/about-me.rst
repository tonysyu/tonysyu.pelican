About me
========

I'm currently a software developer at athenaHealth_, but my background
(B.S., M.S., Ph.D.) is in mechanical engineering.  I'm a core developer for
scikit-image_, the author of mpltools_ and `pypath-magic`_, and a contributor
to Matplotlib_.

As a graduate student, I spent a lot of time developing software in Python_ for
data analysis, image processing, numerical simulation, and visualization.
Eventually, I decided that I didn't like publishing, so I left the ivory tower
of academia and focused on what I liked most: data analysis and visualization.
As a result, I made a fairly easy transition to `Enthought, Inc.`_, where I put
my Python expertise and scientific programming experience to good use.

After that, I decided to abandon science altogether and work as a software
developer at athenaHealth_. Unfortunately, Python is no longer part of my day
job, but I still play around with it when I have an excuse.
