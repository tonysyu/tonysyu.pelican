About me
========


I'm a mechanical engineer who specializes in fluid mechanics and enjoys
developing scientific software using Python_. During the course of my master's
degree and Ph.D., I developed software for data analysis, image processing,
numerical simulation, and visualization. I love when a physical phenomenon can
be explained in an intuitive way; I like it even better if there's a beautiful
plot or diagram to go along with it. (I guess I'm more of a visual learner.)
I'm the author of mpltools_ and a core developer for skimage_. I've also
contributed patches and enhancements to Matplotlib_, NumPy_, SciPy_, FiPy_, and
Quantities_.

I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama (no: my family wasn't the only Asian
family---there's a medical school there;), and at some point, I dabbled with
the idea of becoming an `art major`_. But I do so love perpetuating
stereotypes, so instead, switched to mechanical engineering. As part of this
transition, I transferred from Birmingham-Southern College to Columbia
University as part of a 3-2 engineering program (3 years at a liberal arts
school, 2 years at a university offering engineering). Through this dual degree
program, I ended up getting a B.S. from a liberal arts school, which is a bit
strange (or maybe strangely appropriate?).

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University
researching methods of enhancing fog capture for water collection in remote
villages and for improving visibility in areas susceptible to hydrometeors
(that's the technical---and impressive-sounding---name for fog). In the near-ish future, I'll be
looking for a position as a developer of science-related software. I'm open to
other ideas, though.
