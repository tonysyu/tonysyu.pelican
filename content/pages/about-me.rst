About me
========


I'm a mechanical engineer who specializes in fluid mechanics and enjoys
developing scientific software using Python_.  As a graduate student,
I developed software for data analysis, image processing, numerical simulation,
and visualization. I love when a physical phenomenon can be explained in an
intuitive way---even more so if there's a beautiful plot or diagram to go along
with it. I'm the author of mpltools_ and a core developer for scikits-image_.
I've also contributed patches and enhancements to Matplotlib_, NumPy_, SciPy_,
FiPy_, and Quantities_.

I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and at some point, I dabbled with the idea of
becoming an `art major`_. But I do so love perpetuating stereotypes, so
I switched to mechanical engineering. As part of this transition, I transferred
from Birmingham-Southern College to Columbia University through the so-called
3-2 engineering program (3 years at a liberal arts school, 2 years at
a university offering engineering). As a result, I ended up getting a B.S. from
a liberal arts school, which is a bit strange (or maybe strangely
appropriate?).

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University
researching methods of enhancing fog capture. In the near-ish future, I'll be
looking for a position focused on software development for data and numerical
analysis.
