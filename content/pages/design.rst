Matplotlib Banner
-----------------

    :target: matplotlib_

I can't really say I designed the matplotlib_ banner; I came up with a concept and went through a few iterations with the creator of matplotlib_: John Hunter. My original concept looked *really* different from the final design.

In case you were wondering matplotlib_ is a Python plotting library, and the entire banner logo is generated with code. Since I helped with the design, I got to choose some of the equations in the background (notice Navier-Stokes).

GAME_ Logo and Banner
---------------------

    :target: GAME_

I was GAME_ webmaster at one point in time. The first thing I did was redesign the logo (it was originally a cog made in Solidworks). If you look really closely, the highlights in the gears spell out GAME ... sort of. Made entirely in `Inkscape <http://www.inkscape.org/>`__.

I used to do a bit of sculpture, painting, and drawing which can be found on
my `old art page <../pages/artwork.html>`_.
