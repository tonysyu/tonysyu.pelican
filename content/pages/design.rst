Design

I used to do a bit of `sculpture, painting, and drawing`_. Now, I just
contribute web logos for random sites (listed below from newest to oldest).

Scikits-image Logo and Banner
=============================

.. image:: images/design/skimage_logo.png
    :target: scikits-image_

I'm a collaborator for scikits-image_, which is an image-processing library.
So the basic idea I had was to take the SciPy_ (which is sort of the parent of
all the "scikits") logo and combine it with some image processing. I chose an
edge filter (Sobel) as the image processing step. The logo is coded_ using
scikits-image_ plus the standard scientific Python tools (NumPy_, SciPy_, and
matplotlib_)

Matplotlib Banner
=================

.. image:: images/design/mpl_logo.png
    :target: matplotlib_

I'm an *occasional* contributor to matplotlib_, so when someone on the mailing
list mentioned a new logo, I submitted my attempt. I can't really say
I designed the matplotlib_ banner; I came up with a concept and went through
a few iterations with the creator of matplotlib_: John Hunter.

In case you were wondering matplotlib_ is a Python plotting library, and the
entire banner logo is `generated with code`_. Since I helped with the design,
I got to choose some of the equations in the background (notice Navier-Stokes
at the top).

GAME_ Logo and Banner
=====================

.. image:: images/design/game_banner.png
    :target: GAME_

I was GAME_ webmaster at one point in time. The first thing I did was redesign
the logo (it was originally a cog made in Solidworks). If you look really
closely, the highlights in the gears spell out GAME ... sort of. Made in
Inkscape_.
