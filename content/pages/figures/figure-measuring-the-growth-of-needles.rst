Figure: Measuring the growth of needles

.. image:: images/research/needle_sequence.png

Top: Successive snapshots of a cluster of needles growing during
solvent-annealing. The top-left needle from the cluster is tracked over time in
the bottom image.

Bottom: Slice of micrograph-pixels along the axis of a needle as a function of
time. The dark curved line is the location of the needle tip of the needle as
a function of time. The images on the left and right show the needle near the
beginning and end of the annealing process.
