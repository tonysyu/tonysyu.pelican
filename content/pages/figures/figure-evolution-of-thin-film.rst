Figure: Evolution of thin film
==============================


.. image:: {filename}/images/research/film_evolution.png

Simulations of evolving thin film with a solid needle growing from the left.
Initially, the fluid film has a uniform thickness with a slight roughness. The
film becomes unstable and breaks up into small drops due to a competition
between surface tension and intermolecular forces.
