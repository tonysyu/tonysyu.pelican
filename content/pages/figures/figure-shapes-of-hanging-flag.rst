Figure: Shapes of hanging flag
==============================

.. image:: images/research/flag_sequence.png

Images of a long, thin sheet, *i.e.* "flag" (black) clamped to a jet-nozzle
(green in image). Water, which flows along one side of the flag, induces
bending. The flow velocity is steadily increased from left to right. An
analytical model (blue line) matches experiments well at high flow rates.
