Figure: Fog tunnel
==================


.. image:: {filename}/images/research/fog_tunnel.png

Fog tunnel for imaging the flow and deposition of water droplets onto
substrates. We use an ultrasonic nebulizer (which basically just vibrates
a small container of water really quickly) to generate small droplets. This
"fog" is carried by an air flow over a substrate, and we use a microscope
objective to capture images.
