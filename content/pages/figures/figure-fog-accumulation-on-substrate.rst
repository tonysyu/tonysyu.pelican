Figure: Fog accumulation on substrate
=====================================


.. image:: images/research/accumulation_on_textured_and_flat.jpg

Water drops on a substrate with both textured (top-half) and smooth
(bottom-half) regions. We use dark-field illumination so that surfaces parallel
with the image plane (like the substrate) are dark but inclined surfaces (like
the edges of drops) are bright. Drops on the top half grow in an organized
fashion due to the texture (square array of square pillars).
