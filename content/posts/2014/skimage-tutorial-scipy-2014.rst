Juan Nunez-Iglesias, a fellow core-developer of `scikit-image`_, and I gave
a scikit-image tutorial at `SciPy 2014`_! I gave the first 2 hours (minus
a quick intro), and Juan gave the second 2 hours. Surprisingly, this was the
first tutorial at the (U.S.) SciPy conference (Emmanuelle Gouillart gave a
tutorial at `EuroSciPy 2013`_).

Anyway, if anyone happens to have 4 hours to kill, here are links to the
videos:

- `Part 1 <http://youtu.be/MP-MTiCETYg>`_
- `Part 2 <http://youtu.be/SE7h0IWD93Y>`_
- `Part 3 <http://youtu.be/Yxpnvc4RHy4>`_
- `Part 4 <http://youtu.be/pWnYjqudKHs>`_

But, even if don't want to watch these videos, the accompanying notebooks are
worth a look: `notebooks on github`_. Currently, the scikit-image website
doesn't have any introductory tutorial docs, so this is probably the most
complete source for introductory material. I'd like to integrate these
notebooks as a user guide on the website, but that may take a bit of time.

Enjoy!
