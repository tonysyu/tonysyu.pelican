Source control for scientists and soloists
==========================================

Normally when people talk about source control, it focuses on collaboration: if
you're collaborating on code and you're not using source control, you're doing
it wrong! If you're just working on your own code, though, you should still be
using source control.

This is a text version of a presentation I gave for my old lab group, back in
the day when I was in academia. If anyone needs to adopt source control, it's
scientific programmers: Scientists often develop code for themselves
(collaboration often focuses on the results, not the code), so we're prone to
think that source control is not relevant. The purpose of this article is to
convince you that source control is important---*even if you're the only one
looking at the code*.

I'll be focusing on git, since it's what I use for my day-to-day routine, but
any (distributed) version/source/revision control software will do. Some
commands will differ for other software, but the basic concepts are still the
same.


Motivation
==========

As mentioned above, this was written as a presentation to scientific
programmers, and a large part of that presentation focused on motivating
scientists to use source control. To that end, here's why you should be using
source control:

* There are often huge time gaps between breaking code, and realizing that your
  code was broken. Source control remembers when you don't.
* You should document your rationale for changing code. (commit message)
* It's key to reproducible research: You keep a lab notebook for a reason (your
  memory sucks). Version control is your code notebook.

Because this motivation part is so important, I put this into context with
real-world examples below.


Basic Concept
=============

* Save code as logical sets of changes and write a good description of why you
  changed it.
* Now you have a history of changes, that means you can:

  - look back at your rationale
  - change back if you need to
  - find out where things went wrong
  - remove code with the knowledge that you can easily go back


Why you should use source control
=================================

The purpose of this article is to convince you to use source control, so I want
to give concrete examples of how source control helps you. These examples are
taken from a Matlab code base that I adopted. In addition to my frustrations
with dealing with Matlab (<3 Python), I had to navigate a code base that was
sorely lacking the benefits of source control, which is what prompted my
original presentation.

All examples are taken from real changes that I made to my adopted code base.
Apologies to the original authors of this code.


You're already trying to fake it!
---------------------------------

Here are some files from the code base I adopted.

.. image:: images/posts/2013/duplicates_directory.png

You can see there are some newer versions of some files, but the author didn't
want get rid of the older files ... just in case. Or wait, are some parts of
the code still using the older versions? Yes, you can easily search (grep,
`grin <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grin>`_, ack, whatever), but don't make me
do extra work: I'm lazy.

Let's look closer at the two duplicates at the bottom: ``id_paths.m`` and
``id_paths2.m``. Here's is a ``diff`` of those two files:

.. image:: images/posts/2013/id_paths_diff.png

Note that these files were a few hundred lines each, but the **only**
difference between these two files are the lines highlighted in red. If there's
a newer version of something, just keep the newest version! Version control
will allow you to go back if really need to; otherwise, it's just
a distraction.


You don't delete enough code!
-----------------------------

(or: "Stop commenting out code and delete it already!")

Sometimes you add debugging code when you're developing your algorithms, but
the final product shouldn't have the code, so you do this:

.. image:: images/posts/2013/commented_out_code.png

Notice the return statement in the middle of that code block. What you don't
see above is that there are a few hundred more lines of code that never get
run because of the early return statement. Keeping all that code around makes
it harder for you when you revisit the code. If you want to keep some debugging
code, save that separately so that you can easily focus on the important stuff.

The basic commands
==================


``git init``: Create a repository
---------------------------------

This is important to know, but it isn't that exciting. You just go into the
directory that contains all of your code (subdirectories will be included) and
run ``git init`` to create the git repository (i.e. "repo"). This just needs to
be done once per project.

Just think of the repository as a place where the history is being stored.
A lot happens behind the scenes but who cares. (Maybe you care, but only after
you really know how to *use* it.)


``git add`` and ``git commit``: Save changes
--------------------------------------------

The concept of ``add`` and ``commit`` can be a bit confusing, especially if
you're coming from some other version control systems. Many other version
control systems just do what's equivalent to ``git commit --all`` (or ``git
commit -a``).

So let's assumed that we're just committing everything for now. This basically
saves all your changes... "But wait, I've been saving my changes in my
editor/IDE; hell, it even auto-saves." The power of committing your changes
to git is that you save the history. This concept is much more powerful than
something like `Time Machine`_. You had a reason for changing your code: You
should document it (e.g., "Fix for when the signal is all zeros", "Update code
to <this paper that improves on the original algorithm>"). Sure you could add
a code comment to (poorly) document a few lines that changed, but what if those
changes spanned multiple parts of the code. Your commit (and *descriptive*
commit message) groups those logical changes together.

Note: For the remainder of this article, I might use "commit" and "version"
interchangeably. "commit", the noun, is more-or-less synonymous with version
(although you might consider a "version" a collection of commits), whereas
"commit", the verb, is a way of saving a "version".

*After* you get into the habit of committing your changes using
``git commit --all``, you'll want to evolve towards explicitly calling
``git add`` to specify which files you want to add to a specific commit. This
helps you group your changes better and helps you write a better, more
*descriptive* commit message.

``git add``: Organize your save
...............................

We're not always great at concentrating on a single change. Explicitly
specifying the files you want to add to the commit will force you to be more
organized about the changes you made.

``git add`` puts your changes into what's called the "staging area", and then
then you call ``git commit`` to commit everything from the staging area.

More advanced: If you've made changes that aren't really part of the same
fix/feature/whatever, you can add specific lines, but that's for another post.

``git log``: Your code history
------------------------------

The log is your code notebook. You have a history of all the commits you have
made. Most scientists want a history of the calculations they've done with all
the missteps and epiphanies documented. Sometimes you just don't remember why
you did something. This is a quick way to look back in time when your memory
fails you.

``git diff``: What did I do?
----------------------------

(or: "Finally! this works. Wait. What actually fixed the problem?")

You've made a ton of changes to fix some bug or add some feature. Inevitably,
you've made some changes that weren't really part of the feature (e.g. print
statements for debugging). ``git diff`` allows you to check what has changed
from the original implementation.

More advanced: If you're using the staging area properly, you call
``git diff --staged`` to make sure that all the code you've added really
pertains to the (very descriptive) commit message you're going to write.


``git checkout``: Revisit old code
----------------------------------

(or: "Argh, I wish I hadnâ€™t made these changes!")

I know my function didn't behave this way before,... wait am I sure about that.
Well, you can always go back to old code by checking out an older version.

``git blame``: When and why was this line added?
------------------------------------------------

(or: "Why did I write this?")

We've all looked at some part of our code and forgotten why we added needed it.
``git blame`` allows you to look at when it was added, and your (very
descriptive) commit message tells you why.


``git bisect``: When did this *behavior* change?
------------------------------------------------

(or: "When did this stop working?")

Warning: Using ``git bisect`` is bit more difficult than some of the other
commands. So if you're new to this, I'd wait to really try it out, but it's
definitely a tool worth learning as you get more comfortable.

Ok, so you know that an old version of the code worked differently before
(you know because you can go back to old versions with ``git checkout``), but
what was the actual change in the code that caused the change in behavior.

``git bisect`` allows you to efficiently find that change. Just write a test
that indicates the change in behavior. A test that gives a thumbs up or down is
ideal, but sometimes you just might have a plotting script that clearly shows
the change in behavior. Just identify the commit that has the "good" behavior
and ``git bisect`` will keep checking out different versions of the code, and
you just give that version a thumbs up or down.

``git bisect`` is as smart as you wish you always were: It looks at the version
right in the middle of what you know to be good and bad. If the version in the
middle is good, then the defect must have been added in the later half; if it's
bad, then the defect must have happened in the earlier half. Keeping doing this
until you narrow it down to the precise version.


Summary
=======

* Stop trying to invent your own version control
* Reproducibility and history are very important (especially for scientists)
* The basic usage of git is pretty simple. (If you're not comfortable on the
  command-line though, there are tools to help you out---see below.)
* Good commit messages are important
   - Bad:   "update code"
   - Good:  "Add calculate_standard_error function", "Fix for NaN inputs"

This describes git usage from the perspective of someone who's comfortable
using the command line. Since programming isn't the focus of many scientists,
you may not be as comfortable on the command line. Fear not: There are many
GUI clients for git. I can't really throw my weight behind any of them since
I don't use any of them, but `SourceTree`_ and `SmartGit`_ both look pretty
popular.

In the end, I don't think I was successful in converting any of my fellow
scientists to use source control. The problem is that it takes a bit of
discipline at the very beginning, and, like many things in life, it's hard to
see the benefits until you've already invested a bit of time to learn it.

Now that my day job is software development, I don't need to convince anyone
of the benefits of source control. But maybe there's a scientist out there who
does need some convincing ...
