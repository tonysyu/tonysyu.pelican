Favorite vim commands

Normal mode
===========

`.`: repeat command
   I use this frequently to replace the more cumbersome multiplier convention.
   For example, instead of `d3w` to delete 3 words in front of the cursor,
   I would most likely use `dw..` to delete next word and repeat twice. I find
   this to be much easier than counting letters, words, lines, etc.

`;`: repeat last line-search movement
   By line-search movment, I mean `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` commands. If I want 

`g;`: go to previous edit
   With other text editors, I find myself using undo to find a place in
   a file. If you just want to go back to the last edited position, that's not
   a bad solution. But, if you want to go to the edit before that, then it
   gets difficult (because you have to redo (or undo?) the previous "undo"s).
   With vim, you can just do `g;g;`---repeat as necessary.
